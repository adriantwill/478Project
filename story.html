    <h1>Why do we watch the NFL?</h1>
    <p>
        The NFL (National Football League) is the most valuable sports franchise in the world, earning over 20 
        billion dollars during the 2023 season. Such mind-boggling sums are not merely a product of the sports 
        athleticism, they are also the result of the narratives that been crafted over the course of decades. 
        In this ARTICLE we wanted to answer a key question, does an NFL team have to be successful on the field to 
        be popular off of it?  
    </p>
        To answer this question we first need to define what makes a team popular. For our analysis we have chosen
        to look at the viewership data for each game for the 2023 season to see which team is able to attract attention
        through the season.

        As shown by the chart the NFL maintains a fascinating balance of viewership and popularity  
        with no teams consistently dominating the viewership numbers and no teams struggling to find an audience.
        This equilibrium suggests that while performance is important it is not the only metric fans use to choose teams. 
        The rest of the article will take a look at comparing the most popular team this season (Dallas Cowboys) with 
        one of the least popular teams (Arizona Cardinals). However, we invite you to make this visualization more personal:
        choose your favorite team and see how their performance and viewership stacks up against our chosen teams.

        Finally we wanted to show how each team is influenced on a week by week basis. It is clear that the most popular teams have by far the most attendence, as seen by the dark blue squares.
        This specific team popularity is shown because even the least popular teams have viewership spikes when a they play a more popular team.
        There is also a consitent increase in viewership in week one where there is the most excitement around the start of the season.
