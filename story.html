    <h1>Why do we watch the NFL?</h1>
    <p>
    The NFL (National Football League) is the most valuable sports franchise in the world, earning over 20 
    billion dollars during the 2023 season. This level of revenue for an entertainment product is only 
    possible because of the stories that have been crafted over decades. In this article we want to 
    investigate, does an NFL team have to be good to be popular?

    The first step in determining who the most popular teams is to determine what metric is being used to quantify 
    popularity. We have chosen to look at a teams game by game viewership to analyze the popularity of the NFL.

    <p>Looking at this chart its clear the NFL teams manage to maintain an equilbirium of viewership and popularity,
        with no team truly dominating the viewership numbers and no team being completely left out to dry. 
        The rest of the article will take a look at comparing the most popular team this season (Dallas Cowboys) with 
        the least popular team (Arizona Cardinals). However, we want to make this more interesting for you so we want 
        you to find your favorite team and compare how they are doing compared to our selection.
