          The NFL (National Football League) is the most valuable sports
          franchise in the world, earning over 20 billion dollars during the
          2023 season. Such mind-boggling sums are not merely a product of the
          sports athleticism, they are also the result of the narratives that
          been crafted over the course of decades. In this ARTICLE we wanted to
          answer a key question, does an NFL team have to be successful on the
          field to be popular off of it?

          To answer this question we first need to define what makes a team
          popular. For our analysis we have chosen to look at the viewership
          data for each game for the 2023 season to see which team is able to
          attract attention through the season.

          As shown by the chart the NFL maintains a fascinating balance of
          viewership and popularity with no teams consistently dominating the
          viewership numbers and no teams struggling to find an audience. This
          equilibrium suggests that while performance is important it is not the
          only metric fans use to choose teams. The rest of the article will
          take a look at comparing the most popular team this season (Dallas
          Cowboys) with one of the least popular teams (Arizona Cardinals).
          However, we invite you to make this visualization more personal:
          choose your favorite team and see how their performance and viewership
          stacks up against our chosen teams.

          Finally we wanted to show how each team is influenced on a week by
          week basis. It is clear that the most popular teams have by far the
          most attendence, as seen by the dark blue squares. This specific team
          popularity is shown because even the least popular teams have
          viewership spikes when a they play a more popular team. There is also
          a consitent increase in viewership in week one where there is the most
          excitement around the start of the season.
